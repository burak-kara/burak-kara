Hey I'm Burak 👋🏻,

I have been working in the field of video streaming for more than three years. I've gained experience in 360-degree video streaming and low-latency streaming. I am constantly looking to learn and improve my skills, and I am always open to new opportunities and challenges.

📚 I am a Ph.D candidate [@Inria](https://team.inria.fr/ermine/) while I work at [@Synamedia](https://www.synamedia.com/) Rennes as an Assosiate Software Architect. Previously, I recieved my Master's and Bachelor's degree from [Ozyegin University](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en), Turkiye. During my master's degree, I worked on 360-degree video streaming with [Nokia](https://www.bell-labs.com/) for more than 2 years. In this project, we have filled three patent applications, and published three conference and one journal papers. The publications can be found [here](https://burak-kara.dev/academic).

💼 Besides my academic background, I had opportunities to work with such talented colleagues at amazing companies but in short terms. I've experienced in full-stack development with Node.js based frameworks such as React (JS and TS), NestJS, NextJS by utilizing them in both school and side projects, and also at the enterprise level [@Trendyol](https://github.com/trendyol). I've also exprience in Ruby (on Rails) and Ember.js for six months during my experience [@Parasut](https://github.com/parasutcom). I use Python (Networking, Data Science and scripting), C++ (socket programming), R (plotting and basic data processing), and Shell scripting. More details can be found [here](https://burak-kara.dev/experience). 

I believe languages and frameworks are just tools to solve problems and express our inner creativity. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with trying a new one, at least to suppress an inner curiosity 🤙🤙

🚴‍♂️ I have started to ride in summer 2021 where I was able to ride just a couple of KMs. Since then, I am riding and observing my progress to the current where I can ride more than 100 KMs with ease. Some of my rides can be seen [here](https://burak-kara.dev/social).
