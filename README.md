Hey 👋🏻,

I am an MSc in CS student at Ozyegin University from Istanbul, Turkey. Currently, I am working on a couple of international graduate projects about 360-degree video streaming, Multimedia Systems and Low Latency. In recent years, I have worked on full-stack projects with React (JS and TS), Spring Boot and Python Django. 

I have strong experience in Java (SE, EE, OOP), Python (Networking, Data Science and scripting), React (both JS and TS), and Shell scripting. I also have some experience in R (mainly on plotting and basic data processing).

I would like to gain some experience in Ruby and Go.
