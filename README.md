Hey 👋🏻,

I am a MSc new grad in CS with junior-level full stack developer experience from Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Türkiye. I have been working on multimedia (particularly, 360-degree video) streaming on my academic studies with Nokia (Finland) for more than 2 years. Several papers and patent fillings from these studies can be found at my [website](https://burak-kara.dev/academic#publications).

I have been gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development with React Native, Node.js based frameworks such as React (JS and TS), NestJS, NextJS using in both school, side projects and at the enterprise level. Also, I use Python (Networking, Data Science and scripting), C++ (socket programming), R (plotting and basic data processing) and Shell scripting. Recently, I have started to write in Ruby on Rails and Ember.js for my new occupation.

I believe languages and frameworks are just tools to solve problems and express our inner creativity. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with trying a new one, at least
to suppress an inner curiosity 🤙🤙

I would like to gain some experience Go. I have mainly coding for the commercial products hosted on GitLab. Therefore, the activity here can seem less.
