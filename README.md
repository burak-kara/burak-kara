# Hey, I'm Burak 👋🏻  

I have been working in the video streaming domain for over five years, specializing in green video distribution, multi-CDN delivery, and content steering. My expertise includes 360-degree video streaming, low-latency streaming, and scalable content delivery. I am always eager to learn, enhance my skills, and explore new challenges.  

📚 I am a Ph.D. candidate at [@Inria](https://team.inria.fr/ermine/) and an Associate Software Architect at [@Synamedia](https://www.synamedia.com/), Rennes. As part of the **CTO Innovation team**, I contribute to proof-of-concept demos showcasing novel video delivery approaches, presented at major industry tradeshows like [@IBC](https://show.ibc.org/) and [@NAB](https://www.nabshow.com/). Additionally, I have authored six conference papers, presented at **ACM MMSys** and **ACM MHV**.  

Previously, I earned my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from [Özyeğin University](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en), Türkiye. During my research at [Nokia](https://www.bell-labs.com/) on 360-degree video streaming, I co-authored three patent applications and multiple publications, including three conference papers and one journal paper. My publications are available [here](https://burak-kara.dev/academic). 

💼 In addition to my academic background, I have worked with talented teams at notable companies. I have experience in full-stack development, primarily with **Node.js-based frameworks** such as **React (JS/TS), NestJS, and Next.js**, applied in school projects, side projects, and enterprise environments like [@Trendyol](https://github.com/trendyol) and [@Synamedia](https://www.synamedia.com/). I also worked with **Ruby on Rails** and **Ember.js** for six months at [@Parasut](https://github.com/parasutcom).

## 🔧 My Tech Stack:  
- **Python** (networking, data science, scripting, backend development)  
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (full-stack web development)  
- **C++** (socket programming, scientific computing) 
- **R** (data visualization and processing)  
- **Shell scripting**  

I see programming languages and frameworks as tools to solve problems and express creativity. Trying new technologies keeps things exciting and fuels curiosity. 🤙  

🚴‍♂️ Outside of work, I stay active. I started cycling in 2021, progressing from short rides to 100+ km routes. For the past two years, I’ve also been running and hiking, exploring new trails and challenging myself. Some of my activities are available [here](https://burak-kara.dev/social).
