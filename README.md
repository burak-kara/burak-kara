Hey üëãüèª,

The MSc new grad with junior-level full stack developer experience. Seeking full-time software developer opportunities. Working on a 360-video streaming project and gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development.

I am a new grad MSc in CS student at Ozyegin University from Istanbul, T√ºrkiye. I have been working on a 360-degree video streaming project with Nokia (Finland) for 2+ years. Also, I have been writing code on full-stack projects with React (JS and TS), NestJS, NextJS, Spring Boot and Python Django for both school, side projects and at the enterprise level. 

I have strong experience in JavaScript/TypeScript-based frameworks such as React, React Native, NestJs and NextJs. I also have experience in Java (Spring Boot), Python (Networking, Data Science and scripting), C++ (socket programming), R (plotting and basic data processing) and Shell scripting.

I would like to gain some experience in Ruby and Go.

I have been mainly coding for the commercial products hosted on GitLab. Therefore, the activity here can seem less.
